This namespace includes and adaptation of Boost.GIL for sound
processing. The changes include:

- Factor out concepts.hpp so it is partly defined in psynth::base
- gil_config.hpp is replaced by psynth/base/compat.hpp
- The terminology have been changed in this way:
   *   Color          = Channel
   *   Color Space    = Channel Space
   *   Color Base     = Channel Base
   *   Channel Value  = Sample
   *   Channel        = Sample
   *   Pixel          = Frame
   *   Image          = Buffer
   *   Image View     = Buffer View
- rgb.hpp, cmyk.hpp, rgba.hpp, removed.
- Added mono.hpp, stereo.hpp, quad.hpp, surround.hpp.

- Some naming conventions have changed:
   Color Tag: name_t   => Channel Tag: name_channel
   Color Space: name_t => Channel Space: name_space
   Color Layout: name_layout_t => Channel Layout: name_layout
- removed position_iterator, locator, virtual_locator, point2d
- TODO: position_iterator can inspire time handling!!!
- TODO: implement virtual_iterator from virtual_locator?
- For the dynamic_image we do: any_* => dynamic_*
    - Importamos todo en el raiz y los ficheros que se llaman igual
      que otros les ponemos dynamic_* en el nombre.
    - We import everything in the root of psynth::sound and the files
      that are named like another are prepended dynamic_*
- NOTE: It is not a good idea to mix boost type_traits and the ones of stl.

Please, remember to check diffs between GIL releases to fix bugs and
add functionallity to our version.
