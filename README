The Psychosynth project aims to create an interactive modular
soft-synth inspired by the ideas of the Reactable. We will try to
provide a clean object oriented API to allow the creation of new
innovative interfaces for the synthetizer and a 3D simulator of a
Reactable-alike device with support for collaborative music creation
over the internet.

This package provides
---------------------

  * **libpsynth**: This is a powerful modern C++ library for the
    building of synthesis software. Type-safe audio buffer and I/O
    abstractions, inspired by
    [Boost.GIL](https://boost.org/libs/gil),
    a generic system modular synthesis engine, classes for the
    synchronization of synths over the network using OSC, a framework
    for easy application creation, among other stug....

  * **psynth3d**: An interactive synth with an look similar to the
    Reactable's and a 3D interface which makes use of all the power of
    libpsynth.

  * **psynth**: A command line version of the synth that can be used
      as OSC server or client with low resource usage.


Depdencies
----------

To try the software you will need these third party libraries and programs:

   * GNU Autotools (only for the development version)
   * Ogre (needed by the 3D interface)
   * CEGUI (needed by the 3D interface)
   * OIS (needed by the 3D interface)
   * liblo (needed for the network support)
   * libxml2 (needed for XML config support)
   * Alsa (needed for ALSA sound output)
   * Jack (needed for Jack sound ouput)
   * libsndfile (needed for pcm file support)
   * libvorbis (needed for OGG vorbis file support)
   * SoundTouch (needed for sample stretching)
   * Boost

In Debian and Ubuntu you can install all those dependencies with the
following command. Anyways, I suggest installing `liblo` from the
original sources because the version in the repositories is outdated
and contains a bug:

```
  sudo apt install cmake libogre-1.9-dev libois-dev \
                   libcegui-mk2-dev libasound2-dev libjack-dev \
                   liblo-dev libsndfile-dev libxml2-dev \
                   libsoundtouch-dev libvorbis-dev libboost-dev
```

Installing
----------

This project uses the [CMake](http://cmake.org/) build system generator.
To compile from sources, do:

```
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  cmake --build .
```

You can then **install** the software by doing

```
  sudo cmake --build . -t install
```

You may customize the installation folder by passing
`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<destination-folder>` to the `cmake ..`
command.  There are other settings you can pass with
`-D<setting>=value`, you may list all of them with `cmake .. -LH`.
Also, there are other things you can do besides building or
installing, see `cmake --build -t help` to list all possible targets.
